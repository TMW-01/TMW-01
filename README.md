## Hello, I'm Furkan üëã

I'm an Engineering Student that mostly works on Embedded Systems Development. I create solutions for devices that is usually limited in resources. I like to work on software side of things but I also work with hardware.

### My Projects

I use STM32 for most of my embedded projects but I also use other ARM based devices when needed.
I usually work on Baremetal targets but I'm trying to improve on RTOS and Embedded Linux.

- **STM32 Driver:** I'm currently working on developing a custom driver for STM32 devices. Started as trying to get out of vendor IDE environments but evolved into something more than that. I'm using C/C++ for the driver.

- **STM32 Code Generator:** I'm working on developing a project to generate files for the above mentioned project and make it easier to start using the driver. I use Python and CMake to create the necessary environment.

### Languages
